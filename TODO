-Test cdpatch and ensure it works
-Finalize some kind of utility for patching AR
-Finish adding cheats game list menu:
 -I already have a basic gui started
 -Game List is being fetched and displayed.
 -Cheat List is being fetched and displayed. 
 -Codes list still needs to be added.
 -Selected cheats should be highlighted.
 -Add ability to add/edit cheats
 -Add ability to add/edit games(and master code)
 -Add ability to delete cheats
 -Add ability to delete games
 -Allow user to enable commlink communication when using cheats
 -games and title need to be center aligned.
 
-Add individual games' cheat list menu.
-Add the hook code.
-Implement splash screen
-Add support for vcd's(don't check region)

DONE: -Add support for audio cd's(use bios's cd player)
DONE: -Finish coding bup hijack code.
DONE: -Write bup hijack windows-end utility.
-Consider adding my toolkit I wrote a while back
-Add a short cut that keeps the program from booting the disc and instead goes
 to some kind of menu
-Remote debugging of games(first UBC's breakpoint for communication, second for actual breakpoints. Any additional breakpoints can be done via modified instructions and using illegal instruction exceptions)
-Local debugging of games(should be a lot easier to implement. Use VDP1 for display)
-Add virtual cd support(fetch data from commlink instead of cd block). Might be easiest to latch onto the GFS library.
-Finish Implementing cd patcher
